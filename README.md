# M.I.E. Ledger 

M.I.E. (Math In Europe) Ledger is a simple Android App with a Rails REST API that tracks loans made 
between members of small groups then calculates net balances based on database queries.

Note: This Android App is not avaliable in Play Store

## Motivation

During the 2018 Math In Europe program hosted by the University of Waterloo, our group of friends learned that tallying transactions individually was literally unbearable after doing it for a week.

That's when [Edward](https://github.com/eddddddy) and I decided to hack up a simple Ledger App for QoL purposes.
